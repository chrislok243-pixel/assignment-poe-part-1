 Base style
I added a CSS reset and set base styles font family, font size in rem, line-height.
this makes typography clean, consistent, and easy to read on all devices.

 Visual style
 I used colors, borders, and box-shadows to give sections and buttons a modern look.
This improves readability and gives the site a professional, trustworthy design.

 Layout structure
I applied CSS Grid and Flexbox to organize header, navigation, content, and footer.
âœ” This keeps the layout clear and easy to navigate, especially on desktop.

Visual decorations
Already included with colors, backgrounds, and shadows.
âœ” These decorative elements make the site more attractive and user-friendly.

 Pseudo-classes
 I used :hover, :focus, and :active for buttons and links.
âœ” This makes the site interactive and gives users feedback when they click or focus.

Responsive design
 I used media queries for tablet/mobile ,â‰¤768px and desktop ,â‰¥769px.
 Navigation switches from multi-column to single-column. Images are responsive, and relative units (rem, %) keep everything flexible.
âœ” This ensures the website adapts seamlessly to any screen size.
