 Base style
I added a CSS reset and set base styles font family, font size in rem, line-height.
this makes typography clean, consistent, and easy to read on all devices.

 Visual style
 I used colors, borders, and box-shadows to give sections and buttons a modern look.
This improves readability and gives the site a professional, trustworthy design.

 Layout structure
I applied CSS Grid and Flexbox to organize header, navigation, content, and footer.
✔ This keeps the layout clear and easy to navigate, especially on desktop.

Visual decorations
Already included with colors, backgrounds, and shadows.
✔ These decorative elements make the site more attractive and user-friendly.

 Pseudo-classes
 I used :hover, :focus, and :active for buttons and links.
✔ This makes the site interactive and gives users feedback when they click or focus.

Responsive design
 I used media queries for tablet/mobile ,≤768px and desktop ,≥769px.
 Navigation switches from multi-column to single-column. Images are responsive, and relative units (rem, %) keep everything flexible.
✔ This ensures the website adapts seamlessly to any screen size.
